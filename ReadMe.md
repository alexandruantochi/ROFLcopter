###ROFLcopter Project Overview

ROFLcopter was created as a homework project for my 1st year introducting to C++ class.

It is similar to Flappy Bird, although it stretched more horizontally than vertically. 
The real inspiration is the flash game "Chopper".

The gameplay is simple: press any key for the ROFLcopter to go up and do not crash into the wall of WTF.
